<p>Testnet is a testing environment where developers and users can try out the functionality of a blockchain project,
without putting real assets or data at risk.
It helps to ensure that the final product is reliable and secure for users to use.
If you like to read more about the Testnet you can check out our post on
“<a href="/ar/2023/03/01/what-is-testnet.html">What is Testnet?</a>”.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>In May 2023, we <a href="/ar/2023/05/09/testnet-1-launched.html">launched</a> our second Testnet.
The main purpose of this Testnet was to measure block time creation and the responsiveness of the blockchain.
The development team also focused on evaluating the network’s performance.
Additionally, the overall performance of the software and the syncing process were closely examined and assessed.</p>

<p>The <a href="/ar/learn/consensus/committee/">committee</a> for Testnet-1 was set to 21 validators,
and 584 validators <a href="/ar/2023/07/05/testnet-500-validators.html">joined</a> during the Testnet period.
More than 600,000 blocks were created, and more than 1 million transactions were processed during this time.
The size of the blockchain is about 300 megabytes.</p>

<p>About 300,000 coins were staked during this period, it was almost 50% of the total generated coins.
It shows that users, even in Testnet, tend to stake their coins.</p>

<p><img src="https://pactus.org/blog/images/2023-07-25-testnet-1-concluded/staked_coins.png" alt="Staking chart" /></p>

<p>We were able to extract the confirmation time of transactions using transaction
<a href="/ar/learn/transaction/stamping/">stamps</a>.
More than 97% of transactions were confirmed in just one block after submission.
This indicates that the transaction pool and broadcasting models are working fine.</p>

<p><img src="https://pactus.org/blog/images/2023-07-25-testnet-1-concluded/transaction_confirmation.png" alt="Transaction confirmation chart" /></p>

<p>Based on logs from one of the validators, the time for creating a block is about 3 seconds in normal cases.
More than 97% of blocks are committed in the first rounds.</p>

<p><img src="https://pactus.org/blog/images/2023-07-25-testnet-1-concluded/consensus_round.png" alt="Consensus round chart" /></p>

<p>During Testnet-1, we released three versions(Version
<a href="https://pactus.org/2023/05/29/release-0-11-0.html">0.11.0</a>,
<a href="https://pactus.org/2023/06/19/release-0-12-0.html">0.12.0</a>,
<a href="https://pactus.org/2023/07/01/release-0-13-0.html">0.13.0</a>), and the upgrade process was smooth.
At this time, the development team decided to stop Testnet-1 and work on improvements that are not backward compatible,
including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improving the consensus protocol</li>
  <li>Reducing the blockchain size</li>
  <li>Optimizing the network usage</li>
</ul>

<p>After stabilizing the changes, we will announce the next Testnet, and hopefully, this will be the pre-launch Testnet.</p>

<h2 id="spacial-thanks-to-the-community">Spacial thanks to the community</h2>

<p>This Testnet was important for us.
It helped us learn what we need to do to make Pactus work even better.
Without the community that supports us and dedicates their time and resources to testing and feedback,
we wouldn’t have been able to progress as we have.</p>

<p>we thank all of them for their valuable contributions.
As promised, <strong>participants in Testnets will be given priority as validators for the MainNet</strong>, and
will receive bounty tokens from the bootstrap accounts to set up their validator.</p>

<p>We are grateful to all those who participated in Testnet-1, and
we encourage them to join our next Testnet to help us improve Pactus.
As a community-based project, we rely on the support of our community members, and we value any help we receive.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="announcement," /><category term="testnet" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[About testnet]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dev meeting</title><link href="https://pactus.org/2023/07/09/dev-meeting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dev meeting" /><published>2023-07-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pactus.org/2023/07/09/dev-meeting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pactus.org/2023/07/09/dev-meeting.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="meeting-summary">Meeting Summary</h2>

<p>The meeting took place on 09 July 2023, at 2:00 PM UTC via Google Meet,
with team members from different time zones joining to discuss key aspects of the Pactus project.</p>

<h2 id="overview-to-the-network-module">Overview to the Network Module</h2>

<p>The meeting began with an overview of the Network module in Pactus.
This module uses <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> as its underlying network protocol.</p>

<p>The Network module is agnostic about the content of the message and
handles two types of messages: Gossip messages, which are broadcasted,
and Stream messages, which are sent directly to a specific peer.
The team discussed the relay nodes that enable communication for nodes behind NAT.
Upon receiving a message, the module publishes an event.
The two types of events are Gossip events and Steam events.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/2023-07-09-dev-meeting/network_messages.png" alt="Network messages" /></p>

<p>The team discussed the issue of Relay connections resetting, and explored solutions such as
<a href="https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/nat/hole-punching/">hole punching</a> or using UDP and IPv6.</p>

<p>Some users in the Testnet reported high network usage.
The team discussed implementing metrics for LibP2P to monitor network usage effectively.
The discussion related to this issue can be found <a href="https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/discussions/571">here</a>.
Additionally, the team discussed the customization of network resources,
including setting limits for inbound and outbound connections.</p>

<h2 id="overview-to-the-sync-module">Overview to the Sync Module</h2>

<p>Moving on, the Sync module was discussed.
Unlike the Network module, the Sync module has full knowledge about the messages and packets.
The module handles a range of message types, which can be found
<a href="https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/blob/239bb98120053a220c6732989d9a4541ff0c4fc9/sync/bundle/message/message.go#L41C1-L52C2">here</a>.</p>

<p>It was suggested that we need to define metrics for each message type.
There was also a discussion about the need for reducing the messages to optimize the use of network resources.</p>

<p>The team decided to continue discussing these topics in future meetings.
They also plan to work on improving the Network and Sync modules based on these discussions.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="dev-meeting" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meeting Summary]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">500 validators joined Testnet</title><link href="https://pactus.org/2023/07/05/testnet-500-validators.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="500 validators joined Testnet" /><published>2023-07-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pactus.org/2023/07/05/testnet-500-validators</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pactus.org/2023/07/05/testnet-500-validators.html"><![CDATA[<p>For a <a href="/ar/learn/consensus/proof-of-stake/">Proof of Stake</a> blockchain, validators are important for
maintaining the network’s integrity and security. They are similar to miners in Proof of Work blockchains like Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Pactus as a real Proof of Stake blockchain, has achieved a significant milestone.
More than 500 validators joined the <a href="/ar/2023/05/09/testnet-1-launched.html">Testnet</a>
in less than 2 months.
This accomplishment proves that Pactus is reliable, resilient, and trustworthy. More importantly, it sets new standards
in the blockchain world. In fact, <strong>the Pactus Testnet is even more decentralized than some well-known blockchains.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://pactus.org/blog/images/2023-07-05-testnet-500-validators/500_validators.png" alt="500 validators of testnet" /></p>

<p>One key reason why Pactus can accommodate more validators is its powerful
<a href="/ar/learn/consensus/protocol/">consensus mechanism</a>.
The consensus mechanism in Pactus eliminates the need for delegation, making it possible for anyone to become a validator.
Additionally, the user-friendly application ensures that even those new to blockchain can easily contribute to the network.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-next">What is the next</h2>

<p><strong>To remain competitive in the market, Pactus recognizes the importance of prioritizing user space.</strong>
We aim to ensure that running Pactus is affordable and accessible to anyone, regardless of their technical expertise or
available resources.</p>

<p>To achieve this, the Pactus team constantly monitors network, storage, and computational usage, striving to keep them
at minimal levels.
By doing so, we enable more individuals to participate in the Pactus blockchain.</p>

<p>Currently, the Pactus team is working on optimizing and reducing network usage. This effort will lead to reduced costs,
especially for users who are using home internet connections.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we are planning to introduce a pruning mode, allowing users to run the Pactus blockchain with significantly
less storage.
Although we believe the storage size is already small, our goal is to enable users to
retain only the most recent blockchain history.
This approach ensures that the blockchain size remains as compact as possible by disregarding some history of the blockchain.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="validators," /><category term="testnet" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a Proof of Stake blockchain, validators are important for maintaining the network’s integrity and security.

<p>Testnet is a testing environment where developers and users can try out the functionality of a blockchain project,
without putting real assets or data at risk.
It helps to ensure that the final product is reliable and secure for users to use.
If you like to read more about the Testnet you can check out our post on
“<a href="/ar/2023/03/01/what-is-testnet.html">What is Testnet?</a>”.</p>

<h2 id="summary-of-testnet-0">Summary of Testnet-0</h2>

<p>In September 2022, we <a href="/ar/2022/09/24/testnet-0-launched.html">launched</a> our first Testnet.
The purpose of this Testnet was to
check the <a href="https://pactus.org/learn/consensus/protocol/">consensus protocol</a>,
test different <a href="https://pactus.org/learn/transaction/format/">transaction</a> types,
and ensure the stability of the blockchain.
We also wanted to test the <a href="https://pactus.org/learn/consensus/sortition/">sortition algorithm</a>
to make sure it works properly.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://pactus.org/learn/consensus/committee/">committee</a>
for the Testnet-0 was set to five validators, and more than 19 validators joined during the Testnet period.
<strong>Over 2 million blocks were created, and more than 3.2 million transactions were processed during this time.
The size of the blockchain is approximately 1 gigabyte.
The maximum number of transactions recorded in a single block was 386</strong>. With a block time of 10 seconds,
we can confirm that Pactus blockchain can support up to 30 transactions per second (TPS),
which is a reasonable number for TPS. Based on real-time statistics available at <a href="https://realtps.net/">realtps</a>,
we can see that Pactus is among the top 10 blockchains in terms of TPS.</p>

<p>At this point, the development team decided to <strong>end the Testnet-0</strong> and move on to the next one,
Testnet-1. We are planning to run the Testnet-1 to prepare for the MainNet launch.
We will provide updates on our progress and share the details of the new Testnet soon.</p>

<p>As promised, <strong>participants in Testnets will be given priority as validators for the MainNet</strong>,
and will receive bounty tokens from the bootstrap accounts to set up their validator.
We are grateful to all those who participated in Testnet-0, and we encourage them to join our next Testnet to
help us improve Pactus.
As a community-based project, we rely on the support of our community members, and we value any help we receive.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="announcement," /><category term="testnet" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is testnet?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What is a Testnet?</title><link href="https://pactus.org/2023/03/01/what-is-testnet.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What is a Testnet?" /><published>2023-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pactus.org/2023/03/01/what-is-testnet</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pactus.org/2023/03/01/what-is-testnet.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="mainnet-vs-testnet">Mainnet vs Testnet?</h2>

<p>If you have ever wondered what Testnet is and how it is different from Mainnet, read this article to the end to find out!</p>

<p>Mainnet and Testnet are two widely used terminologies in the Blockchain ecosystem;
so it is important to understand the meaning and differences while working in the industry or
following announcements of the Blockchain projects like Pactus.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick explanation:
Before the actual live version of a Blockchain network that is used for real transactions,
functions and smart-contracts (which is referred as Mainnet),
there is a test version of the Blockchain network for testing purposes (which is referred as Testnet).
In Testnet, a safe environment is provided to help developers experiment and test their applications,
and make sure that everything functions smoothly in the Mainnet version.</p>

<h2 id="testnet">Testnet</h2>

<p>A Testnet is a simulation of a Blockchain, in which developers can test all the functionalities of
their Blockchain network without risking their assets and convenience of end-users.
Using Testnet, any possible error, bug or malfunctions can be fixed before the Mainnet launch.
Testnet also can be an experimental environment for new features, updates and upgrades.
So several Testnet networks of the same version or newer version of the Mainnet can be implemented on the roadmap.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-use-cases-of-testnet">What are use cases of Testnet?</h2>

<p><strong>A secure environment to test development ideas and updates.</strong>
So many features and minor details in Pactus project have been successfully developed so far using the Testnet; such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>extra details and information on Pactus-GUI;</li>
  <li>well-functioning Pactus Blockchain explorer to access transactions and block details;</li>
  <li>Upgrades that led to decreasing the size of the Pactus network</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Providing a safe testing ground for resolve scalability and security problems, as well as decentralization issues.</strong>
Pactus network is also a secure and purely decentralized network. However in the last updates during the Testnet,
developers are now able to decrease the database size by approximately 10% without compromising performance.
They did it by utilizing block height instead of hash to store blocks within the database. (you can find out more
<a href="https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/pull/416">here</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Testing new versions, patches and features on Testnet.</strong> it is vital for enhancing the security, load testing,
Blockchain migration, integration tests, and etc. This is why you can now use the latest version of Pactus-GUI
that works like clockwork and is extremely secure.</p>

<p><strong>Testing the functions of cryptocurrency without disrupting the Mainnet.</strong> In the Testnet of Pactus Blockchain,
you as a user or validator can use all the features to send, receive, bond or unbond your assets in the Pactus-GUI.</p>

<p><strong>Development and simulation of smart contract features and DApps.</strong> Note that many Blockchain projects like Pactus,
can be used as smart-contract platforms. So the Testnet can be designed in different stages to test and improve
different applications of the network.</p>

<p>Please note that after a certain period of time, when developers get satisfied with the functionality and debugging process,
they launch Mainnet. Mainnet has its own independent genesis blocks;
so the assets and addresses that users use in Testnet are not valid inside the new Mainnet Blockchain anymore.
In fact the whole Blockchain network starts working from the scratch and users and validators start to
work with real tokens and transactions instead of the simulated ones. But since Testnet has an important effect
on the health and improvement of the network, in Pactus Blockchain, we have several advantages
for the people who join the Testnet.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-you-join-the-testnet">Why should you join the Testnet?</h2>

<p>There are different contributors in a Blockchain network;
Some people are developers and programmers that use the Testnet to contribute, enhance and lead the project to a better future.
Testnet is actually vital for them to perform their changes and try their innovations and ideas.</p>

<p>But you might also be an end user; you might want to either be a validator and stake your assets to earn more Pactus coins,
or you might want to learn <strong>how to use the network for future</strong> personal applications. Either way,
you might find it handy to give it a try and be familiar with Pactus-GUI and its different features.</p>

<p><strong>However, there is another advantage for end users who join the Testnet.</strong>
While using the network, running a node or testing the Pactus-GUI in Testnet period, you are contributing to
the community to find improvement potentials, that’s why there are more advantages contemplated for the Testnet users;
Soon our Mainnet will be launched and also Pactus network will be announced and listed in well-known exchanges.
As an early contributor, you will have the advantage of getting some extra initial tokens at the beginning of Mainnet launch.
So that you can use it to run a validator node and earn more from staking your assets. This airdrop is considered
for every individual who installs Pactus-GUI and starts a node in Testnet.</p>

<p>There are other positive conditions you may experience as an early contributor.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Advanced and very responsive support for your issues (we dedicate more time to provide you with solutions)</li>
  <li>Embracing your suggestions, improvement ideas, needs and information you may require to have a better user experience.</li>

<p>After reviewing the responses, the team chose “Pactus” as the new name for the project. 🎉
The project will be moved to “pactus-project/pactus,” and the team plans to announce it on social media.</p>

<h3 id="discussion-on-gui">Discussion on GUI</h3>

<p>In terms of the GUI, Joseph suggested using Flutter, and the team agreed.
To interact with the wallet, gRPC APIs will be provided, and the GUI will use these APIs.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="dev-meeting" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meeting Summary]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dev meeting</title><link href="https://pactus.org/2022/08/29/dev-meeting.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dev meeting" /><published>2022-08-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-08-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pactus.org/2022/08/29/dev-meeting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pactus.org/2022/08/29/dev-meeting.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="meeting-summary">Meeting Summary</h2>

<p>The meeting took place on 04 September 2022, at 2:00 PM UTC via Google Meet,
with team members from different time zones joining to discuss key aspects of the Pactus project.</p>

<h3 id="nanomsg-instead-of-zeromq">NanoMsg instead of ZeroMQ</h3>

<p>During the meeting, Joseph suggested using Nanomsg instead of ZeroMQ because building ZeroMQ is not easy,
especially in Windows. Additionally, we can use the pure Go implementation of Nanomsg.</p>

<p>The format of block events was defined as follows:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;event_id: 1 byte&gt;&lt;event_data: variant&gt;&lt;height: 4 bytes&gt;&lt;seq_num: 4 bytes&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As a consequence of this, smart contracts events can be defined more easily and
Infura-like services become simple, as we can just replay the events.</p>

<h3 id="reviewing-a-pull-request">Reviewing a Pull Request</h3>

<p>Nagaraj’s <a href="https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/pull/355">pull request</a> reviewed.</p>

<h3 id="renaming-project">Renaming project</h3>

<p>The team discussed renaming (rebranding) the project and decided to create an online survey to
gather suggestions for a new name.
Everyone is encouraged to participate in the survey and suggest new names for the project.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="dev-meeting" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meeting Summary]]></summary></entry></feed>
